 ## Functionalities:

    API data deconstruction with useState Hook and map;
    
    UseState and useEffect Hooks to change dyamically the Index from de API array, and change the content shown  over time with setInterval, in this case using the clearInterval method also when pressing the buttons;
    
    Add and change CSS classes in html tags dynamically, via short-circuit-validation to configure the slider.
